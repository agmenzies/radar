Domain Driven Design,Adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://domainlanguage.com/ddd/"">Domain Driven Design</a></strong> (DDD) is an approach to software development that centers the development on programming a domain model that has a rich understanding of the processes and rules of a domain.</p>"
Test Driven Development,Adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<p><strong><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development"">Test Driven Development</a></strong> (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.</p>"
Feature branches and Pull Request reviews,Adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<p><strong>Feature branches and Pull Request reviews</strong> are a way to manage changes in a codebase. Developers create a new branch for each feature or bug fix, and then create a Pull Request to merge the changes back into the main branch. The Pull Request is reviewed by other developers before the changes are merged.</p>"
Python type checking,Adopt,techniques,FALSE,"<p><strong>Python type checking</strong> is a way to add type hints to Python code to help catch errors early.
